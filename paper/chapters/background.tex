\chapter{Background}

Dynamic mapping is becoming an increasingly important requirement for digital musical instruments. This chapter surveys currently available tools that allow for manipulation of musical and non-musical networks in real time. The first section presents a review of mapping itself, both from a theoretical and a musical standpoint. This portion also introduces the libmapper application programming interface. The second section reviews relevant work in the visual representation of information. The third section of this chapter describes applicable techniques in user interface design. Finally, a review of user interfaces for mapping is presented.

\section{Mapping}

	At the most fundamental level, \emph{mapping} is the act of associating two or more sets of information. Mappings can be mathematical, computational, linguistic (like translation), geographic, or even poetic\footnote{What is metaphor if not the association of unlike things?}. Within the context of DMI design mapping is the relationship between sensor outputs and synthesis inputs. The entire character of a new instrument can be drastically altered though mapping, even while control surface and sound source are held constant \shortcite{hunt_mapping_is_important}. As a result, the theoretical formalism of mapping becomes yet another necessary tool in the modern instrument designer's arsenal.

	\subsection{Mapping Theory}

	From the perspective of mathematics, the term \emph{mapping} is very nearly synonymous with \emph{function} \cite{native_set_theory}, as both describe how one set of numbers corresponds with another. The first group is commonly refered to as the \emph{domain} and the second as the \emph{codomain} or \emph{range}. An in-depth description review of functions in mathematics is beyond the scope of this thesis, however a few fundamental examples will be useful for reference in section \ref{sec:mappingforDMIs}. The following are examples of the four basic types of mathematical functions,\footnote{Though not all are technically functions.} as relevant to musical mapping:
	\begin{equation} y = x + 1 \end{equation} \label{eq:one-to-one} \vspace*{-0.7cm}
	\begin{equation} y = x^2 \end{equation} \label{eq:one-to-many} \vspace*{-0.7cm}
	\begin{equation} y = \pm\sqrt{x} \end{equation} \label{eq:many-to-one} \vspace*{-0.7cm}
	\begin{equation} y = \pm\sqrt{1 - x^2} \end{equation} \label{eq:many-to-many} \vspace*{-0.7cm}

	As we can see in

This would make it possible to use the information with different software, platforms and devices, and also allow for sharing data between research institutions.''
