\chapter{Applications \& Discussion}

This chapter presents a discussion of the GUIS software design and its consequences for musical mapping. The interface's features are explored in an attempt to evaluate the successes and failures of the design. Each subview

\label{sec:responsiveness_and_reliability_testing}

Extension of interface features discussed in section \ref{sec:extension_of_control_and_visual_elements} leads to some control possibilities that could be difficult for the GUI to handle. Addition of shortcut keys for connecting, linking, disconnecting and unlinking, as well as the ability to select multiple devices and signals at once allows users to create and delete hundreds of connections with a single keypress.
