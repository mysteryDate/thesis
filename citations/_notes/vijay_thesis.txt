Notes on Vijay's thesis:

  Things need to be more flexible
  What level are things written for? It seems quite elementary, is that normal?

  Page 19: "In the computer science context, a mapping is an abstract data type or concrete data structure, commonly referred to as an associative array or dictionary [9]."

  MSN - Musical sensor network
  Why not imagine all DMIs as MSNs?
  Vijay argues this is a "simpler" concept

  !Data Visualization Design!

  Grudin [19] seems like an important guy

  Use automatic processing (graphics) not controlled processing (text)

  Recognition > Recall

  It is more confusing to be confronted with an empty set than too much [36]

  On Page 46 there is the Wandereley/DePalle list of DMI stuffs

  ? Deployment environment (59)

  Page 60-61 have the description of an interesting implementation that obviously Vijay did not get to. Webmapper.

  Page 65: # control surfaces ~= # of sound generators (safe assumption)

  ? Bezier curves and bundling

  Page 69: This is the method that Holten uses [1]. In future work, using Holtenâ€™s connection clustering algorithm in Vizmapper would be a net benefit, however it is not included at the time of this thesis.

  Page 77: This is like link, there should be a visual display, smoothing, thresholds, etc.

  Future work on page 80

  Page 83 is motherfucking killer.

  Todos: get vizmapper, webmapper
