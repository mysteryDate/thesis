	End of introduction - "We have tried to create a GUI that is intuitive and trans- parent: relationships between parameters are visible at a glance, and changing mappings and scaling requires only a few mouse clicks. We have used all of these tools in a real collaborative context, allowing us to present not only implementations, but also observations of their effect on our group dynamic and workflow. We have tried to create an interface that is useful not only for technical users, but also as a creative tool for composers and performers."
